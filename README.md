# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions
## in C

I enjoyed trying out C for [last year](https://github.com/techniman/advent-of-code-2020)'s puzzles, so I'm doing it again!

To run day 1:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/techniman/advent-of-code-2021
$ cd advent-of-code-2021
$ gcc src/01.c src/utils.c -o bin/01.exe && bin/01.exe
```

Day 3 also requires linking the math library (add `-lm` to the build instruction).

Tested in Ubuntu WSL2 on Windows 10.
